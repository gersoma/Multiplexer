# Multiplexer
The general learning objectives of this project is to see how 4 to 1 and 2 to 1 multiplexers could be combined to form an 8 to 1 multiplexer, and to create the 8 to 1 multiplexer using block diagrams and VHDL. Another learning objective is to use a .ucf file to configure an FPGA board, and to navigate and use different areas of the Xilinx ISE software.


1. Create an 8 to 1 multiplexer block diagram using two 4to1 and one 2 to 1 multiplexers.
2. Develop the truth table and create the VHDL code no the Xilinx ISE design software 
3. In the VHDL code, include the .vhd files for the 4 to 1 and 2 to 1 as components.
4. Create a test bench and give values to the inputs for the circuit
5. Simulate the circuit and capture the waveform using the software.
6. Open the .ucf file and map the inputs to the switches on the FPGA board.
